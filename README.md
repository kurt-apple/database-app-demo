# database-app-demo
Database-connected inventory management app I made as part of WGU: C195: Advanced Java Concepts
- JavaFX/JavaSE 8
- MySQL using JDBC (sorry, database IP scrubbed)
- Overuses lambda (course sortof required it to demonstrate lambda mechanical fluency)
   
Enjoy!   
NB: If you are a current WGU student, feel free to use this as an example, but WGU has source code originality software so do your own work.
